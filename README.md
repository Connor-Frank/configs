Configs (using symlinks pointing to files in this repo)

My Neovim config is a slightly modified version of Chris Chiarulli's [NVCode](https://https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/nvim).  
Same goes for my VSCode config (his blog post is [here](https://www.chrisatmachine.com/Neovim/22-vscodium-neovim/)).
